                <a>In the blog post, I will talk about the evolution of freakybob.site, how it came to be, and how it stopped getting major updates.</a>
                <h2>Pre-Domain Purchase</h2>
                <a>Before the freakybob.site domain was purchased, in a small server, a user by the name of <b>@wish_yt</b> mentioned a freakybob.com domain. After this message was sent, everyone went to looking at domains until a another user by the name of <b>@awesome_squirrel</b> tried buying the freakybob.com domain, only to find out that the domain costed <b>$879</b> with a estimated value of <b>$1,024</b>.</a>
                <br><br>
                <div class="wish1">
                    <img src="../assets/images/blog/evolutionoffreakybobsite/wish1.png">
                </div>
                <div class="picturecaptioncontainer">
                    <a id="picturecaption">@wish_yt mentioning the freakybob.com domain</a>
                </div>
                <br>
                <a>After finding this out, Squirrel went on to find a freakybob domain that was cheap enough for him to purchase. He then found <b>thefreakybob.com</b> for $0.01, with the normal price being $21.99. He then finds a another domain named <b>freakybob.net</b>, so Squirrel questioned the users on <b>thefreakybob.com</b> or <b>freakybob.net</b>. <b>@saam07</b> then mentions that the <b>freakybob.net</b> domain costed <b>&pound;10.05 pounds ($12.67 dollars)</b>.<br><br></a>
                <a>After some time, he finds a domain named <b>freakybob.site</b> that costed <b>$0.98</b>, after hearing this, he questioned the people in the server if he should buy the domain. He then finds some other domains, such as <b>squirrel.site</b>, costing <b>$1,999</b>, and <b>squirrel.net</b>, costing <b>$27,000</b>. Eventually Squirrel buys the <b>freakybob.site</b> domain for <b>$0.98</b>, leading to the birth of <b>freakybob.site</b>.</a>
                <br><br>
                <div class="squirrel1">
                    <img src="../assets/images/blog/evolutionoffreakybobsite/squirrel1.png">

                <div class="picturecaptioncontainer">
                    <a id="picturecaption">@awesome_squirrel mentioning that he bought the freakybob.site domain for $0.98</a>
                </div>
                <h2>Post-Domain Purchase</h2>
                <a>After the domain was purchased, a repository called <b>5quirre1/Freakybob.site</b> on <b>GitHub</b> was made. At the time, Squirrel did not know JavaScript yet. So the first version of the website was eventually basic, due to Squirrel asking Wish to work on Main Page while Squirrel worked on the page that contained the people who made <b>freakybob.site</b> possible.</a>
                <br><br>
                <div class="firstversion">
                    <img src="../assets/images/blog/evolutionoffreakybobsite/8-19-2024.png">
                </div>
                <div class="picturecaptioncontainer">
                    <a id="picturecaption">The first version of the website on 8/19/2024</a>
                </div>
                <br>
                <a>However after a day, Squirrel improved the Main Page, which contained Audio and better CSS. Now to avoid making this blog post long, i'll only describe certain days and versions of the website.</a>
                <br><br>
                <a>The Internet Explorer version of freakybob.site was created on September 12th, 2024, its function was to support the Internet Explorer browser. It is no longer being maintained as of February 17th, 2025 due to the browser being old.</a><br><br>
                <a>Pretty soon after the Internet Explorer version was launched, the Wii U and the 3DS version of the website was released on September 15th, 2024. They are no longer being maintained as of October 19th, 2024 for the Wii U version and November 9th, 2024 for the 3DS version due to the respective browsers being too old for modern CSS and JavaScript.</a>
                <br><br>
                <a>On September 14th, 2024, the repository was forked to <b>Freakybob-Team/Freakybob.site</b>, after it was forked, Squirrel archived the original repository, leading to further development being taken on the fork. Among this, on September 21st, 2024, the website's Pikidiary account was created with <b>UID: 164</b> and the username being <b>freakybob</b>. Eventually the Freakybob team decided to venture into games, websites, sub-domains, scripts, apps, custom coding languages, and extensions by using the following coding languages:</a>

                <a>On December 14th, 2024, the Music Gallery was discontinued and its page was removed from freakybob.site. 6 days later, the new freakybob.site look was being rolled out, 4 days later, the entire look was rolled out. On January 26th, 2025, the themes update was released, containing the theme before November 4th, 2024 and the current theme.</a>
                <h2>Discontinuation</h2>
                <a>On February 16th, 2025, the freakybob.site website was unfortunately discontinued, since the team was out of ideas since December, however patches and events will still be provided to freakybob.site, only major updates has been discontinued. On the good side, Squirrel will keep paying for the freakybob.site domain, so the subdomains and the website itself will still exist. If Squirrel did not pay for the website, all the subdomains and the website itself would be gone on August 19th, 2025.</a>
