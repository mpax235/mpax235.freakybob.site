            <h4>NOTE: The information was gathered by teleporting to far distances in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.</h4>
            <a>While you may think Minecraft is really infinite, it is but due to Computer limitations, it stops at the 32-Bit Floating Point.</a>
            <br></br>
            <a>The distance effects of Bedrock Edition also happens on Java Edition but much far far away due to it using</a>
            <a>64-Bit values instead.</a>
            <br></br>
            <a>So now its time to explore the limits!</a>
            <h2>Exploring the limits</h2>
            <a>Usually the first limit happens 16,384 blocks away from origin but I am unable to notice the minor jittering</a>
            <a>so I went to 32,768 blocks and noticed that it was a little bit jitterly.</a>
            <br></br>
            <a>Then I noticed at 65,536 blocks that when I sneak in and out, it was jitterly too but a little bit.</a>
            <h3>Medium effects</h3>
            <a>I decided to go to 131,072 blocks, it was more jitterly and it turns out that each power makes more jitter from this point.</a>
            <a>262,144 blocks is also jitterly so I went to 524,288 blocks and the jitter effect was more visible.</a>
            </div>
            <h3>Major effects</h3>
            <a>When I went to 1,048,576 blocks, it got even more jitterly so much that the Player can actually</a>
            <a>walk a bit faster now. When I also placed a Lantern, it was stretched but when I placed a Door, it was normal.</a>
            <br></br>
            <a>But when I went to 2,097,152 blocks, I can no longer walk while sneaking, also the Door was now wider on the side.</a>
            <br></br>
            <div class="doorvsthenafter">
                <img src="../sources/blog/bedrocklimits/doorvsthenafter.png">
            </div>
            <a id="smalltext">Door before 2,097,152 blocks (right) and after 2,097,152 blocks (left)</a>
            <br></br>
            <a>At 4,194,304 blocks, your journey ends here on Survival if you don't have Ender Pearls, Elytra with Fireworks, Riptide Trident, Horseback, Boats or Chorus Fruit as the minimum speed is now changed to</a>
            <a>5 blocks.</a>
            <br></br>
            <a>Now at 8,388,608 blocks, it is 8,388,608 blocks away before the Game's terrain breaks,</a>
            <a>also the Entities less then 1 block will fall through the Blocks (includes Players). The only mobs that can stand on the terrain in this point are Minecarts (if rails are placed correctly), Ravagers, Boats, Spiders (normal only), Iron Golems, Shulkers, Polar Bears and Horses (grown only).</a>
            <a>Badlands generation also breaks by Terracotta Strata being distorted and more blocky.</a>
            <h2>Game-breaking effects</h2>
            <a>16,777,216 blocks marks the start of the Stripe Lands, every second block is now considered "Invalid", the camera breaks</a>
            <a>if you are in those "Invalid" spaces. Sadly this is how far I can go due to the Teleportation limit of 30,000,000 blocks.</a>
            <br></br>
            <a>However it does not end here. Thanks to AntVenom's video, I figured that using PocketMine lets me teleport beyond 30,000,000 blocks.</a>
            <a>When i tried it with
            <a id="code">tp mpax235 33554432 100 0</a><a>, it did not work but going to 30,000,000 blocks and then running</a>
            <a id="code">tp mpax235 ~3554432 100 0</a><a>, it actually did teleport me to 33,554,432 blocks.</a>
            <br></br>
            <a>At 32,554,432 blocks, horizontal rendering no longer works, only leaving the vertical rendering which makes terrain 2D on vertical sides. This is the Slice Lands.</a>
            <a>In the Corner Slice Lands however, rendering almost stops entirely due to it being 1D. However entities still generate</a>
            <a>in the Corner Slice Lands.</a>
            <br></br>
            <a>I also noticed the gaps doubled from 2 blocks to 4 blocks, this continues with each double of coordinates like changing gaps to 8 blocks, 16 blocks, 32 blocks, 64 blocks and so on.</a>
            <br></br>
            <a>Something strange is that when I teleported to 2^30, the terrain beyond this point was invisible due to the gaps</a>
            <a>being 128 blocks. But when I increased the Render Distance, I can now see the terrain.</a>
            <br></br>
            <a>Sadly I cant show you more on whats beyond 2^31 as thats the 32-Bit Integer Limit and when I try to pass it,</a>
            <a>the game will just crash.</a>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <a>Now that I showed you all the limits, I will show the table below that lists the Distance Effects.</a>
