                <h4>NOTE: The information was gathered by teleporting to far distances in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.</h4>
                <a>While you may think Minecraft is really infinite, it is but due to Computer limitations, it stops at the 32-Bit Floating Point limit.</a>
                <br></br>
                <a>The distance effects of Bedrock Edition also happens on Java Edition but much far far away due to it using</a>
                <a>64-Bit values instead.</a>
                <br></br>
                <a>So now its time to explore the limits!</a>
                <h2>Exploring the limits</h2>
                <a>Usually the first limit happens 16,384 blocks away from origin but I am unable to notice the minor jittering,</a>
                <a>so I went to 32,768 blocks and noticed that it was a little bit jitterly.</a>
                <br></br>
                <a>Then I noticed at 65,536 blocks, that when I sneak in and out, it was jitterly too but a little bit.</a>
                <h3>Medium effects</h3>
                <a>I decided to go to 131,072 blocks, it was more jitterly and it turns out that each power makes more jitter from this point.</a>
                <a>262,144 blocks is also jitterly so I went to 524,288 blocks and the jitter effect was more visible.</a>
                <h3>Major effects</h3>
                <a>When I went to 1,048,576 blocks, it got even more jitterly so much that the Player can actually</a>
                <a>walk a bit faster now. When I also placed a Lantern, it was stretched but when I placed a Door, it was normal.</a>
                <br></br>
                <a>But when I went to 2,097,152 blocks, I can no longer walk while sneaking, also the Door was now wider on the side.</a>
                <br></br>
                <div class="doorvsthenafter">
                    <img src="../assets/images/blog/bedrocklimits/doorvsthenafter.png">
                </div>
                <div class="picturecaptioncontainer">
                    <a id="picturecaption">Door before 2,097,152 blocks (right) and after 2,097,152 blocks (left)</a>
                </div>
                <br>
                <a>At 4,194,304 blocks, your journey ends here on Survival if you don't have Ender Pearls, Elytra with Fireworks, Riptide Trident, Horseback, Boats or Chorus Fruit as the minimum speed is now changed to</a>
                <a>5 blocks. More than the speed of 4.3 blocks for the Player.</a>
                <br></br>
                <a>Now at 8,388,608 blocks, it is 8,388,608 blocks away before the Game's block rendering breaks.</a>
                <a>Entities less than 1 block will fall through the Blocks (includes Players). Entities will also fall through the Void barrier which is not what they are supposed to do. The only mobs that can stand on the terrain in this point are Minecarts (if rails are placed correctly), Ravagers, Boats, Spiders (normal only), Iron Golems, Shulkers, Polar Bears, and Horses (grown only).</a>
                <a>Badlands generation also breaks by Terracotta Strata being distorted and more blocky.</a>
                <h2>Game-breaking effects</h2>
                <a>16,777,216 blocks marks the start of the Stripe Lands, every second block is now considered "Invalid", the camera breaks</a>
                <a>if you are in those "Invalid" spaces. Sadly this is how far I can go due to the Teleportation limit of 30,000,000 blocks.</a>
                <br></br>
                <div class="stripelands">
                    <img src="../assets/images/blog/bedrocklimits/stripelands.png">
                </div>
                <div class="picturecaptioncontainer">
                    <a id="picturecaption">Stripe Lands rendering beyond 16,777,216 blocks. Looks broken huh? The "Sky" color stripes are "Invalid" spaces while the "Grass" spaces are "Valid" spaces.</a>
                </div>
                <br>
                <a>However it does not end here. Thanks to AntVenom's video, I figured that using PocketMine lets me teleport beyond 30,000,000 blocks.</a>
                <a>When i tried it with
                <a id="code">tp mpax235 33554432 100 0</a><a>, it did not work but going to 30,000,000 blocks and then running</a>
                <a id="code">tp mpax235 ~3554432 100 0</a><a>, it actually did teleport me to 33,554,432 blocks.</a>
                <br></br>
                <a>At 33,554,432 blocks, horizontal rendering no longer works, only leaving the vertical rendering which makes terrain 2D on vertical sides. This is the Slice Lands.</a>
                <a>In the Corner Slice Lands however, rendering almost stops entirely due to it being 1D. However entities still generate</a>
                <a>in the Corner Slice Lands.</a>
                <br></br>
                <div class="slicelands4x">
                    <img src="../assets/images/blog/bedrocklimits/slicelands4.png">
                </div>
                <div class="picturecaptioncontainer">
                    <a id="picturecaption">Slice Lands rendering beyond 33,554,432 blocks. Horizontal rendering stops beyond this point.</a>
                </div>
                <br>
                <a>I also noticed the gaps doubled from 2 blocks to 4 blocks, this continues with each double of coordinates like changing gaps to 8 blocks, 16 blocks, 32 blocks, 64 blocks and so on.</a>
                <br></br>
                <a>Something strange is that when I teleported to 2^30, the terrain beyond this point was invisible due to the gaps</a>
                <a>being 128 blocks. But when I increased the Render Distance, I can now see the terrain.</a>
                <br></br>
                <div class="slicelands128x">
                    <img src="../assets/images/blog/bedrocklimits/slicelands128.png">
                </div>
                <div class="picturecaptioncontainer">
                    <a id="picturecaption">1,073,741,824 blocks away into the Slice Lands with a render distance set to 9 chunks.</a>
                </div>
                <br>
                <a>Sadly I can't show you more on whats beyond 2^31 as thats the 32-Bit Integer Limit and when I try to go to it,</a>
                <a>the game will just crash.</a>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <a>Now that I showed you all the limits, I will show the table below that lists the Distance Effects.</a>
                <br></br>

                    Desert Wells, Mineshafts, and Dungeons are unable to generate here.

                <h2>Skygrid</h2>
                <a>In the Corner Far Lands, Far Lands in negative Z coordinates, and past the normal positive Z Far Lands, a Skygrid generates containing a 3D Grid of Blocks in a Pattern, the Blocks there depends on the Biome, Trees and Tall Grass are able to generate on the Skygrid-based Blocks. This results in perfect 3D Blocks above the Ocean. The blocks extends from Y=128 all the way to the Bedrock floor.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Structures generated in the Skygrid follow the same rules as Nothingness. But with a few differences.
                    <br>
                    <a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9679; Tall Ice Spikes are able to generate from Sea Level. Causing it to reach Y = 128.</a><br>
                    <a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9679; Igloos instead generate on Y = 64.</a><br>
                    <a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9679; Prior to Village and Pillage, villages generated at high altitudes between 64 and 128 have tall foundations extending from the Bedrock layer to the main Building.</a><br>
                    <a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9679; After Village and Pillage, they now generate at Sea Level with a floating platform underneath. This is similar to Nothingness.</a><br>
                    <a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#9679; Woodland Mansions are able to generate in the Skygrid.</a>

                <a>More will be coming soon so stay tuned!</a>
