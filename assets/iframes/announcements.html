                <h4>mpax235 Chat App Coming Out Soon! <span id="by">by</span> mpax235</h4>
                <a>The chat app will be coming out soon! Sadly it will be closed-source, this is to improve security of the app. The app is still being improved with security fixes as we don't want the attack that happened against <a href="https://web.senera.chat">Senera</a> <a>to happen against the app. However I will try to release it as soon as I can!</a>
